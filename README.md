Analysing Big Five Personality Traits 

Personality traits analysis has been an active area of research in information systems and its cognate disciplines. However, there are multiple challenges faced by questionnaire-based measurement of personality traits including low response rate and limited access to the individuals. The python code is written to determine the Big-Five personality traits of different groups of celebrities. First, we collected the Twitter posts of celebrities in different professions and used IBM’s Watson Personality Insights tool to determine the personalities of these celebrities. Next, with the help of statistical analysis and visualization techniques, authors determined the personality pattern within and across the group of celebrities. The results demonstrate that there is significant difference across groups of celebrities on three of the Big-Five personality traits—Openness, Agreeableness, and Extraversion. However, there is no significant difference among the celebrity groups on the Conscientiousness and Neuroticism trait.
