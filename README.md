Each seperate Folder in the above repository represents a seperate project. Each folder or project has its own dedicated readme file which gives detailed description of the project. The files which are present outside of the floder are duplicates/copy of the files inside the folders. So I=ignore all other files (.ipynb and pdf) if it is not present inside its dedicated folder.
