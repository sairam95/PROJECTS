The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed.


This is the classic marketing bank dataset uploaded originally in the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset gives you information about a marketing campaign of a financial institution in which you will have to analyze in order to find ways to look for future strategies in order to improve future marketing campaigns for the bank.
